# mongodb-eduhub-project
Eduhub Project (Second Semester)

This project showcases a MongoDB-based backend system for an e-learning platform called EduHub, implemented using PyMongo in a Jupyter Notebook and exported as a Python script.

PROJECT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
1. Clone the repository (if hosted on GitHub):
git clone https://github.com/emeugoma/eduhub-mongodb-project.git
cd eduhub-mongodb-project
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install required packages:
pip install pymongo pandas jupyter.
4. Start your MongoDB server locally (ensure MongoDB is installed)
5. Open the Jupyter Notebook (optional):
jupyter notebook eduhub_mongodb_project.ipynb
6. Or run the Python script directly:
python eduhub_queries.py

 üîç QUERY EXPLANATIONS
- User Profile Update: Update nested fields using $set.
- Email Lookup: Indexing the email field speeds up lookup performance.
- Course Publishing: Updates the is_published field.
- Recommendations: Uses $match, $setIntersection, $addFields, and $sort in an aggregation pipeline to recommend courses.
- Average Grade: Groups submissions by user_id to calculate average grades.
- Recent Users: Filters users by date_joined within the last 180 days.

üöÄ PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS RESULTS

Indexes Used:
- email field in users
- user_id in submissions
Tags in courses for recommendation matching:
- Aggregation Optimization:
- Using $setIntersection avoids expensive application-side filtering.
- $limit and $sort efficiently prioritize top recommendations.

‚ö†Ô∏è CHALLENGES FACED AND SOLUTIONS
1. Validation Errors on Collection Creation

Problem: Repeated errors when creating collections with $jsonSchema. Solution: Ensure the collection is dropped before re-creating it or wrap creation in a try/except block.

2. Data Not Found in Queries

Problem: Many lookups returned "user not found". Solution: Manually verify inserted data and correct field names. Used .find_one() checks with error messages.

3. Date Filtering Issues

Problem: date_joined filter returned no users. Solution: Ensured inserted datetime objects were in the correct format and timezone.

4. Notebooks Not Saving

Problem: Unsaved notebooks failed to create proper scripts. Solution: Saved the notebook manually before exporting to .py.
